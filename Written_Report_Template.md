# Kickstarting with Excel

## Project Background and Purpose

A client is interested in using Kickstarter, a crowd funded project platform, to help guide decision making for launching her play, *Fever*.  Kickstarter is a place where individuals are able to post their projects to in hope of finding investors.  The client would like to know more about what makes a successful play in the U.S based on historical evidence to help guide her goals to create a successful project.  In additiona, the client also has interest in expanding to Great Britain in the future so additional information on success in that location is needed.


## Analysis and Challenges
Over 4000 Kickstarter Projects from around the globe were analyzed using various Excel functions to help better understand what makes a project successful.  The data included projects of various categories (movies, music, and games).  The focus of this analysis was on plays performed in the U.S. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
One part of the analysis performed was to look at the affect that time of year that a project was launched on had on that outcome.  As demonstrated in the image below,  an increased success rate is seen from May through July with May being the peak.  The number of failed projects stays fairly consistent throughout the year with an average of 41.1 failled projects per month.
